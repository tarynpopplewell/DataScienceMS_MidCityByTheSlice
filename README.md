# MidCityByTheSlice
Pizza Price Analysis for the Mid-City Region of San Diego

This project uses a data set I collected for fun and was able to use for the data visualizations class I took as part of my Data Science master's program. I love pizza, and I love a bargain. I wanted to know which local pizza purveyor offered the best bang for my buck. There is a companion Tableau Public viz I made which can be viewed here:

The data collected is limited to what I could freely gather from online menus. I would love to take other features into consideration such as pie or slice weight, crust to cheese ratio, and topping density. I'm not ruling out a slow, limited collection though. It's good to have goals, especially when they revolve around pizza.
